## Background
Imbalanced data sets for Machine Learning classification problems could be difficult to solve.
For example suppose we have two classes in our data set where  the majority class is more than 90% of the dataset 
and the minority is less than 1% but we are more interested in identifying instances of the minority class.
Most of the ML classifiers will reach an accuracy of 90% or more but this is not useful for our intended case.
A more properly calibrated method may achieve a lower accuracy, but would have a higher true positive rate (or recall).


A lot of critical real-data sets are imbalanced by nature like in credit card fraud detection or in the 
Health Care Industry due to the scarcity of data.  Traditional ways to fix imbalanced datasets is either 
by oversampling instances of the minority class or undersampling instances of the majority class (SMOTE).

Instead to tackle these issues, GANS are used to learn from the real dara and generate samples to augment 
the training dataset. A GAN is composed of a generator and a discriminator  (both are deep neural networks). 
The generator will try its best to make a sample by learning from a dataset  and the discriminator will learn 
to predict if a given sample is generated by the generator or if it is from  the original training dataset. 
This indication is then used by Generator in turn to generate data as close to the real data so as to fool
the discriminator.

------------

## The Dataset
The dataset contains 284,807 transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds. 
The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
Each of these observations corresponds to an individual transaction.
A binary response variable 'Class'  indicates whether or not this transaction is a fraud.
The dataset contains 30 features: 
* V1, V2, ... V28 which are anonymized features and uncorrelated after PCA transformations.
* 'Time' and 'Amount'which have not been transformed.

## Implementation Overview

This code trains a generative adversarial network to generate new synthetic data related to credit card fraud csv file. 
It can also read data from any other csv files but the file will need to be transformed so the class variable to predict is 
clearly identified. The code provides an api to visualize the synthetic data, compare the data distributions 
between the real and the augmented data. It also allows to train different classifiers (LogisticRegression, SVM, 
RandomForrest, XGBoost) and compare their performances with the real and augmented datasets. The synthetic data could
be generated using either SMOTE or GANs. Different GANs architectures are proposed (Vanilla GAN, 
Wasserstein GAN, Improved Wasserstein GAN, Least Squares GAN). Finally a random n-classes data set for classification
 problems is provided  and the decision boundaries are plotted on the real and augmented datasets.
